# IoT, MQTT, and Data Logging – Beginner Learning Guide

## 1️⃣ What is IoT (Internet of Things)?
IoT means connecting physical devices (like sensors, smart lights, smart thermostats) to the internet so they can send and receive data.  
Examples:
- Smart homes (lights, thermostats, door locks)
- Smart agriculture (soil moisture sensors)
- Smart cities (air quality monitors)

---

## 2️⃣ What is MQTT?
MQTT (**Message Queuing Telemetry Transport**) is a lightweight protocol for IoT devices.  
It uses **Publish/Subscribe model**:

- **Broker:** The central server that manages messages.
- **Publisher:** A device that sends data to a topic.
- **Subscriber:** A device or app that listens to a topic.

---

## 3️⃣ Key MQTT Concepts
### ✅ Topics
Topics are like **channels** where messages are sent.  
Example topic: `home/sensors/temperature/temp-1`

### ✅ QoS (Quality of Service)
- **QoS 0:** At most once (fast, no confirmation)
- **QoS 1:** At least once (guaranteed delivery, duplicates possible)
- **QoS 2:** Exactly once (guaranteed delivery without duplicates)

### ✅ Persistent Sessions
If a client disconnects, the broker **remembers its subscriptions and queued messages** if `clean_session=False`.

---

## 4️⃣ Why Use JSON?
Sensor data is sent as JSON (key-value format).  
Example payload:
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1754144248.02145,
  "device_id": "temp-1",
  "sensor_type": "temperature",
  "value": 24.5
}
```

## 5️⃣ Why Use CSV and SQLite?
- **CSV** → Simple log file for daily records.
- **SQLite** → A small database to store data for analysis.

---

## 6️⃣ Project Workflow
1. **Sensors (Publishers)** generate random data and send to the MQTT broker.
2. **Subscriber** listens to all topics.
3. Messages are **validated** using a schema.
4. Valid messages are **stored** in CSV and SQLite.

## 7️⃣ Learning Steps for Beginners
✅ Learn Python basics (`variables`, `loops`, `functions`, `modules`).  
✅ Learn about JSON (`json.dumps()`, `json.loads()`).  
✅ Learn how to install Mosquitto broker (`brew install mosquitto`).  
✅ Learn MQTT basics using `paho-mqtt`.  
✅ Understand topics and QoS.  
✅ Practice with CSV (`csv` module) and SQLite (`sqlite3` module).  
✅ Add advanced features like graphs (Matplotlib) and CLI dashboards.
